# resumeWithReact
Assignment
Can you remember the start of your Thinkful journey, back to the resumé you built for Sally Student? We'd like you to use the same fictional character and rebuild the resumé with React.

Requirements
Put your code in an index.html and create a GitHub repository to share it.
Make an App component which will render the full resumé.
Use semantic HTML throughout the page, so, a header, main, section and address.
Include the contact information section with the name, email address, phone number, and a picture. Feel free to choose one or use this image of Ilana from Broad City as a stand-in for Sally.
Include a section for Sally's education.
There should be a section for Sally's employment history with at least 2 entries, each with the company name, job title, dates of employment and a short description.
As a stretch, write some responsive, mobile-first CSS styles for this application to keep practicing those CSS skills. We don't want to go rusty with CSS.
A second stretch would be to use a prop to control the student's name that's being rendered.
